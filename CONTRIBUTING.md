# Contributing to Trifle

## The Rule

**All code must be written by an AI.**

Even trivial fixes. Even one-line changes. No exceptions.

## How to Contribute

1. Ask an AI to make your change (Claude, GPT-4, Copilot, Cursor, etc.)
2. Ask an AI to review the change
3. Submit a PR mentioning which AI(s) you used

## Example

```
You: "Fix the typo on line 42 of editor.js"
AI: [makes the fix]
You: [review it, commit it]
```
