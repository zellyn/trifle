# Trifle Development Sessions

This directory contains the complete AI-assisted development history of [trifling.org](https://trifling.org), a local-first Python playground for education. Every feature, architectural decision, and bug fix was built through conversations with Claude Code.

## About This Documentation

As noted in [CONTRIBUTING.md](../../CONTRIBUTING.md), code can only be added to this project via AI assistance. These session logs provide a complete audit trail of the project's evolution from initial concept to production deployment. What started as a half-serious experiment has become an interesting artifact of AI-assisted development.

## Directory Structure

- `md/` - Human-readable Markdown conversions of each session
- `claude_to_markdown.py` - Conversion script with automatic redaction (based on [simonw/tools](https://github.com/simonw/tools))

Note: Raw JSONL files are not stored in the repository due to their size (90MB+). The markdown files contain all conversation content with sensitive information redacted.

## Development Timeline

### Session 1: Project Foundation
**[d5409a5c](md/d5409a5c-5620-4945-a0e4-2043c94a8f5d.md)** · October 18, 2025 · 8 hours

The beginning. Built the foundational architecture with Google OAuth, SQLite database using sqlc, and comprehensive security fixes.

- Initial project setup
- Google OAuth with email allowlist enforcement
- Victorian-era adjective-noun name generator (64×64 combinations)
- Database schema design with prefixed IDs (`trifle_`, `account_`, `login_`)
- Security fixes: XSS vulnerability, session fixation, CSRF protection
- Created PLAN.md, README.md, and CLAUDE.md documentation
- First GitHub commit

### Session 2: The Marathon Session
**[3a348ab7](md/3a348ab7-292d-4193-bf84-25e452ad87cd.md)** · October 19, 2025 · 20 hours

A massive session that fundamentally transformed the architecture from server-backed to local-first.

- Started implementing Phase 3 backend API (Trifle/file CRUD endpoints)
- Built Ace editor integration with auto-save
- Added Pyodide (Python in WebAssembly) with Web Worker for non-blocking execution
- Created canvas API for graphics programming with pop-out window
- Implemented terminal with `input()` support and ANSI color parsing
- **Major architectural pivot: Removed SQLite entirely, migrated to IndexedDB local-first storage**
- Content-addressable file storage with SHA-256 hashing
- Service worker for offline capability
- Random name generation for trifles

**Notable:** This session shows the dramatic shift from traditional web app to local-first architecture happening in real-time.

### Session 3: The Three-Agent Experiment
**October 19, 2025 · Parallel Sessions**

An ambitious (and somewhat embarrassing) attempt to coordinate three separate Claude Code instances working simultaneously on different parts of the codebase. They communicated via temporary markdown files as a file-based RPC mechanism.

#### [Session 2: Backend Refactor](md/43056adb-de96-4637-849f-4b5416460547.md)
*21:38 - 22:31 (53 minutes)*

- Created name generator module (web/js/namegen.js) matching Go backend word lists
- Pivoted to Phase 2 backend refactoring: SQLite → flat-file storage
- Implemented content-addressable storage system
- Built sync API endpoints
- Coordinated via `session2-1.md`, `session2-3.md` message files

#### [Session 3: UI Layer](md/a6163e97-5975-4452-9abd-c5411a63f2fa.md)
*21:38 - 22:11 (33 minutes)*

- Built landing page and trifle list HTML/CSS
- Dark theme styling matching editor
- Accessibility improvements (ARIA labels, focus styles, reduced motion)
- Mobile-responsive design
- Created integration layer (web/js/app.js)

#### [Session 1: Integration & Documentation](md/01286751-0bad-40d9-976d-23d312a321a6.md)
*22:24 - 22:50 (26 minutes)*

- Built IndexedDB layer with content-addressable storage
- Reviewed backend OAuth implementation
- Updated documentation to use 1Password CLI for credentials
- Integrated all three parallel work streams

**Notable:** While the multi-agent coordination worked, it was overly complex. The sessions accomplished important work but demonstrated that simpler approaches are often better.

### Session 4: Local-First Completion
**[8a0e2c97](md/8a0e2c97-0e3d-428a-9493-bbbef72ba827.md)** · October 20-22, 2025 · Multi-day

Completed the local-first transformation with bidirectional sync and production deployment configuration.

- Finished hybrid UI redesign with light theme restoration
- Implemented complete bidirectional sync with KV store
- Fixed seven distinct sync bugs:
  - Hash verification failures
  - Logical clock conflicts
  - JSON canonicalization for deterministic hashing
  - Offline editor loading
  - Profile synchronization
  - Username flashing after sync
  - Query parameter handling in service worker
- Added WebAssembly detection with helpful error messages
- Modal UX improvements (auto-focus, Cmd+Enter to submit, Esc to cancel)
- Refactored environment variables for reverse proxy compatibility
- Service worker versioned from v1 through v15
- Production deployment configuration
- License changed from MIT to GPLv3

### Session 5: KV Store Refactor
**[686c6e76](md/686c6e76-64a0-4b21-b599-2cec3bdc5a2d.md)** · October 21-22, 2025 · 2 days

Major architectural insight led to complete backend redesign as pure key-value store.

- Started with hash mismatch bug fix
- **Architectural pivot: "What if the server does three things: OAuth dance, store key/values without looking at values, return list of keys with prefix"**
- Deleted entire `internal/db/`, `internal/api/`, `internal/sync/` directories
- Removed SQLite dependency completely
- Implemented file-based KV store (internal/kv/)
- Bidirectional sync with logical clocks for conflict resolution
- Service worker improvements for offline support
- Environment variable configuration (PORT, OAUTH_REDIRECT_URL)
- Production deployment to trifling.org
- WebAssembly troubleshooting (undefined in Chrome, working in Safari)
- Major commit: 38 files changed, 3382 insertions, 4071 deletions

**Notable:** This session demonstrates the power of stepping back and rethinking fundamental assumptions.

### Session 6: Email Allowlist & Notifications
**[88fcc9b5](md/88fcc9b5-d979-4b0c-8617-2db43bdf6408.md)** · October 24-25, 2025

Improved access control and UX polish to make the app more welcoming without requiring login.

- Email allowlist system with `data/allowlist.txt`
- Domain wildcard support (`@example.com` matches any @example.com address)
- Replaced 17 `alert()` calls with dismissible notification banner system
- OAuth error handling improvements
- UI restructuring to de-emphasize login/sync (moved to footer)
- Early avatar editor experiments (button-based mad-lib style)
- Service worker versioning (v16-v20+)
- Email-based authentication (no user IDs, email is identity)

### Session 7: Avatar Editor & Data Import/Export
**[1377bdb9](md/1377bdb9-452e-4370-b3a1-383ea236ceea.md)** · October 25-26, 2025 · 2 days

Added creative personalization features and local backup capabilities.

- **Felt-style drag-and-drop avatar editor**
  - Shape palette: circles, ellipses, rectangles, body shapes, facial features
  - Drag to move, handles for resize/rotate
  - Option-drag to duplicate shapes (with visual ghosting effect)
  - 200 shape limit with auto-delete when dragged off canvas
  - Integer-based shape IDs (finds lowest unused ID)
  - Z-order controls (send to front/back)
  - Persisted in user profile as SVG data
- **Data import/export system**
  - Selective export with checkboxes (profile + individual trifles)
  - Smart conflict resolution based on timestamps
  - Recommendations for import/skip/overwrite decisions
  - Bulk actions (Import All, Skip All, Use Recommendations)
  - JSON format with embedded file contents
- Footer sync button for subtle OAuth access
- Service worker updates (v56 → v60)
- Documentation consolidation (removed PLAN.md, updated CLAUDE.md)
- Three git commits with comprehensive changes

**Notable:** Fixed shape ID collision bug where `nextShapeId` counter reset on page load, causing duplicate IDs with saved shapes.

## Statistics

- **Total Sessions:** 9 substantive sessions (4 warmup sessions excluded)
- **Development Period:** October 18-26, 2025 (8 days)
- **Total Conversation Entries:** 7,133 exchanges
- **Major Architectural Pivots:** 3
  - SQLite → IndexedDB local-first
  - Complex backend → Pure KV store
  - Server-first → Optional sync
- **Service Worker Versions:** 60+ iterations
- **Git Commits:** Multiple throughout development
- **Lines of Code Changed:** Thousands (exact count varies by session)

## Key Architectural Decisions

1. **Local-first design** - All data in browser IndexedDB, no account required
2. **Content-addressable storage** - Files stored by SHA-256 hash, globally deduplicated
3. **Pure KV store** - Server never parses user data, just stores encrypted blobs
4. **Email-based identity** - No user IDs, email is the key
5. **Logical clocks** - Conflict resolution for bidirectional sync
6. **WebAssembly required** - Editor checks and shows helpful error if unavailable
7. **Offline-capable** - Service worker caches entire app

## Interesting Moments

- **Multi-agent coordination via markdown files** - Three Claude instances using file-based RPC
- **Real-time architectural pivots** - Watching fundamental design changes happen mid-session
- **Service worker iteration** - Version numbers climbing from v1 to v60+ across sessions
- **Security findings** - XSS and session fixation bugs caught during development
- **The SQLite deletion** - Entire database layer removed in favor of simpler approach
